removed docstring from handlers
created and implemented the IContainer interface for all classes that can contain other objects. Window, List, and Dialog all implement IContainer.
Setup handler actions so that it is possible to bind more than one action to a handler. This allows the client to add behavior to existing behavior without having to rewrite code, or override methods.

Made several other small changes.
