create eventManager and inherit from it for all classes that handle events, session and elements.
replace all instances of accessible_output2.outputs.auto.Auto.speak with accessible_output2.outputs.auto.Auto.output, to provide more functionallity. If the screenreader running can output braille, it will in adition to speaking.
change session event_handle condition such that if control is not None, it will still check the sessions events 
change Element so that it inherits from EventManager and remove the existing key dictionary. 
Modify event_handler in Element so that it is udilizing the inherited EventManager instance variable self._events.
move class element into a module of its own, and set ao2 = Auto() as an instance variable to be inherited from subclasses.
set default code for abstract method EventManager.handle_event such that any events can be handled correctly just by calling EventManager's implementation of the method. It is still an abstract method though to insure that child classes have a correct behavior for handling events.
rename xtras package to extras. 
rename all modules such that they are using camel case rather than snakecase for prefered style of naming.
Modify example.py such that it is using alt+f4 using a lambda expression, to close the application rather than q.
Rewrite the helpMenu module.
Make several small minor changes.
